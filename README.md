# stl-vba
Collection of VBA scripts

## Introduction
This collection of scripts is intended as a private collection of VBA scripts that have proven useful. They involve a number of classes with useful generic functions, and some procedures that make use of these classes.

## Installation
It is best to install all classes and modules.

All code is written assuming that the `app-properties` class and the `custom-errors` class have been installed, and that the `m-global` module has been installed to automatically initiate instances of the two classes.
